# Authorization

To start using the Jellyfin API, authorization is probably the first thing you'll need to do. Jellyfin's authorization options can be a confusing because there are a lot of deprecated options.

Generally there are three ways to authenticate: no authorization, user authorization with an access token or authorization with an API key. The first way is easy, just do nothing. But most often you'll need to use either the access token or API key.

## Sending authorization values

There are multiple methods for transmitting authorization values, however, some are outdated and scheduled to be removed.
It's recommend to use the `Authorization` header. If header auth isn't an option, the token should be sent trough the `ApiKey` query parameter.

| Type   | Name                   | Method     | Deprecated |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Header | `Authorization`        | Schema     | No         |
| Query  | `ApiKey`               | Token only | No         |
| Query  | `api_key`              | Token only | **yes**    |
| Header | `X-Emby-Token`         | Token only | **yes**    |
| Header | `X-MediaBrowser-Token` | Token only | **yes**    |
| Header | `X-Emby-Authorization` | Schema     | **yes**    |

Avoid sending multiple tokens in one request as it's uncertain which value will be used. Deprecated options may be removed in future server updates.

## The Jellyfin authorization scheme

The [Authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) uses the format `Authorization: <scheme> <parameters>`. The Jellyfin scheme is named `MediaBrowser` and uses named values separated by commas. There is no specific order for parameters. A key can is case sensitive and only allows alphanumeric characters, unknown keys are ignored by the server. Values must be wrapped in double quotes (`"`) and should use [url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_encoding).

```txt
MediaBrowser key="value", key2="value2", key3="value3"
```

### Parameters

| Key      | Description                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Token    | The access token or API key                        |
| Client   | The name of the client                             |
| Version  | The version of the client                          |
| DeviceId | A unique id for the device generated by the client |
| Device   | The device name                                    |

The token parameter is required to use authenticated endpoints. The client and version properties are used to identify the client in the dashboard.

### Examples

- Authenticate with API key

  ```http
  Authorization: MediaBrowser Token="8ac3a7abaff943ba9adea7f8754da7f8"
  ```

- Authenticate with access token

  ```http
  Authorization: MediaBrowser Token="0381cf931f9e42d79fb9c89f729167df", Client="Android TV", Device="Nvidia Shield", DeviceId="ZQ9YQHHrUzk24vV", Version="0.15.3"
  ```

## The ApiKey query parameter

Use the `ApiKey` query parameter when the `Authorization` header can't be used. The value of the query parameter is the access token or API key. Avoid using this option if possible. Never use the `ApiKey` query parameter and `Authorization` header at the same time.
